# WebApplication2
Database script and Postman collection JSON can be found in Extras folder, API key and connection string can be configured in appsettings.json, XUnit tests can be launched via Test Explorer window in Visual Studio. Unfortunately, I failed to make tests work with API key, so in order to execute them properly you'll have to remove the [ApiKey] attribute in controller classes (RegistrationController.cs, SessionsController.cs and UsersController.cs), commenting should do the trick. Docker image also doesn't work but since it might be Docker settings issue on my side, I'll keep Dockerfile and docker-compose here.
